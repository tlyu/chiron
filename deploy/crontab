# scripts.mit.edu sample crontab as of Sun Aug  4 14:41:11 EDT 2013
# To load this crontab, run "cronload crontab" in your cron_scripts directory
# (On athena, you must run "add scripts" before cronload)

# This line sets a reasonable default path
PATH=/mit/chiron/cron_scripts:/usr/kerberos/sbin:/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

# This line mails the STDOUT and STDERR of every cron script to a person
# (can be useful for debugging)
# You can always redirect the output of individual commands to /dev/null
MAILTO="chiron@mit.edu"

# Add your cron lines here:
@reboot SHELL=/bin/bash screen -d -m -c ~/chiron/deploy/run.screenrc


# Here's a reminder of the cron line format:

#  * * * * * command to be executed
#  - - - - -
#  | | | | |
#  | | | | ----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
#  | | | ------- month (1 - 12)
#  | | --------- day of month (1 - 31)
#  | ----------- hour (0 - 23)
#  ------------- min (0 - 59)

# For example, the following cron line would write "Work harder!" to STDOUT
# every 20 minutes from 8am - 5pm on weekdays
# (and this message would thus be e-mailed to the address above on each run) 

# 0,20,40 8-17 * * 1-5 echo "Work harder!"
